* Install **Homebrew**
    * **Homebrew** is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system. 
    ```
    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```

* Install **Homebrew-Cask**
    * **Homebrew-Cask** extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to macOS applications and large binaries alike.
    ```
    $ brew tap caskroom/cask
    ```

* Install **Java Runtime Environment**
    * **JAVA** is required for execution of Jenkins slave file (`slave.jar`) in order to connect with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) master.
    ```
    $ brew cask install java
    ```

* Install **GMake & CMake & pkg-config**
    * **GMake & CMake & pkg-config** are used by [pronto](https://github.com/prontolabs/pronto), which is used for automated code review.
    ```
    $ brew install cmake && brew install homebrew/core/make && brew install pkg-config
    ```

* Install **Bundler**
    *  **Bundler** is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production.
    ```
    $ sudo gem install bundler
    ```

* Add SSH Unknown host
    As all SSH server hosts need to be added to `known_hosts`, we need to add our git provider that hosts our `iOS-certificate-repository` and the project's repository so that our slave can use SSH for git command. In our case, it's Bitbucket & GitHub.
    ```
    $ ssh -o StrictHostKeychecking=no bitbucket.org && ssh -o StrictHostKeychecking=no github.com
    ```
